three points we need to focus on

1. one sampling corresponds to one autozero.
2. os needs to be stored fully, otherwise, the input reference voltage also contains the os part.
3. comp kick noise will influence the result, so we need to reduce comp's current.
Also, we need to focus on the  amp, the gain of amp should be stable in different pvt.
